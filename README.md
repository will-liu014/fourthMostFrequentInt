# Finding the Fourth Most Frequent Integer

## Compilation

```
make
```

## Usage

```
./fourthFrequent
```

Then, input an integer list delimited by a single space between each value.

## Task ##

Write a program (in any language) that finds the fourth most frequent value 
in an integer array. In the case of ties in frequency among multiple values, 
return the smallest of such values.

For example, given the values (as command-line argument inputs)

    4 4 1 2 2 2 2 3 3 3 5 5 5 6 1 5 9

the program should print

    1

## Limitations ##

Exceptions for incorrect inputs (i.e. non-integer inputs) weren't handled meaning command-line input must be a set of integers delimited by a single space. Additionally, a correct solution must be present meaning there must be at least one fourth most frequent value.
